## Spring Inversion of Control

### What is Spring Inversion of Control

***Inversion of Control*** is principle that allow us to control objects through container or frameworks. We can achieve Inversion of Control using Dependency Injection. Idea behind the IOC is, application should be configurable.

#### Advantage of Inversion of Control
1. Inversion of Control makes ***loosely coupled***.
2. Inversion of Control also makes it easy for the programmer to write effective unit tests.

### Spring Container
Spring Container is the core of the Spring Framework. The container will create the objects, wire them together, configure them and manage their complete life cycle from. The container gets its instructions on what objects to instantiate, configure, and assemble by reading the configuration metadata provided. The configuration metadata can be represented either by XML, Java annotations, or Java code.
